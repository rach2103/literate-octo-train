Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a multidisciplinary domain bridging human-computer interaction and affective computing, focused on deciphering emotional states from speech. It integrates signal processing, machine learning, and psychological principles to model the vocal-emotional nexus. Driven by the proliferation of digital platforms and virtual assistants, demand for accurate emotion-aware systems is escalating.

This project focuses on advanced audio signal processing and machine learning for robust, automated classification of emotional states from speech. Utilizing datasets like RAVDESS, the objective is to develop a model demonstrating high emotion classification accuracy and practical real-world utility. This work aims to advance affective computing, thereby enhancing human-computer interaction through nuanced speech emotion decoding.

installation of resampy lies in converting signals from one sampling rate to another while maintaining signal integrity.
